#~ "straight, two L-shaped, one square, and two S-shaped. The blocks fall "

#~ "και δύο σχήμα S. Οι κύβοι πέφτουν από το πάνω κέντρο της οθόνης με τυχαία "
#~ "σειρά. Εσείς περιστρέφετε τους κύβους και τους κινείτε στην οθόνη για να "
#~ "τους ρίξετε και να δημιουργήσετε πλήρεις γραμμές. Αυξάνετε την βαθμολογία "
#~ "σας με τη ρίψη των κύβων γρήγορων και την ολοκλήρωση των γραμμών. Όσο η "
#~ "βαθμολογία σας αυξάνεται, αυξάνεται και το επίπεδο δυσκολίας, και η πτώση "
