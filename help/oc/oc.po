"<application>Gnometris</application> comes from the classic falling-block "

"shaped, one square, and two S-shaped. The blocks fall from the top center of "
"the screen in a random order. You rotate the blocks and move them across the "
"screen to drop them in complete lines. You score by dropping blocks fast and "
"completing lines. As your score gets higher, you level up and the blocks "
