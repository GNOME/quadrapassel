#~ "<application>Quadrapassel</application> comes from the classic falling-"

#~ "create complete horizontal lines of blocks, which will disappear. The "
#~ "blocks come in seven different shapes made from four blocks each: one "
#~ "straight, two L-shaped, one square, and two S-shaped. The blocks fall "
#~ "from the top center of the screen in a random order. You rotate the "
#~ "blocks and move them across the screen to drop them in complete lines. "
#~ "You score by dropping blocks fast and completing lines. As your score "
#~ "gets higher, you level up and the blocks fall faster."
