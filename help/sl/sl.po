"Quadrapassel is GNOME's version of Tetris, the classic game of interlocking "
"four-piece blocks. As they fall from the top, the player must orient them to "
"fit the other blocks at the bottom so that they form a complete horizontal "
"line, in which case that line disappears and the player gains points."

"shaped, one square, and two S-shaped. The blocks fall from the top center of "
"the screen in a random order. You rotate the blocks and move them across the "
