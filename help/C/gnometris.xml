	Gnometris is GNOME's version of Tetris, the classic game of 
	interlocking four-piece blocks. As they fall from the top, 
	the player must orient them to fit the other blocks at the 
	bottom so that they form a complete horizontal line, in which 
	case that line disappears and the player gains points.

 <title>Introduction</title>

<!--synopsis of game-->
  <para><application>Gnometris</application> comes from the classic falling-block game, <application>Tetris</application>. The goal of the game is to create complete horizontal lines of blocks, which will disappear. The blocks come in seven different shapes made from four blocks each: one straight, two L-shaped, one square, and two S-shaped. The blocks fall from the top center of the screen in a random order. You rotate the blocks and move them across the screen to drop them in complete lines. You score by dropping blocks fast and completing lines. As your score gets higher, you level up and the blocks fall faster.</para>

The highest level is 10, at which point you will only have just over a second to manipulate each block.</para>

    <para>By going to <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, you can customize a variety of features for the start-up of each Gnometris game: number and density of pre-filled rows, and starting level. "Pre-filled rows" refers to how many rows will already have blocks in them when you start each new game.</para>
    <sect3 id="s3-numberpfr">
     <title>Number of Pre-filled Rows</title>
      <para>You can change the number of rows that already have blocks at the start-up of each new game by using the spin box. You can start with up to 19 rows pre-filled at the start-up of your game. The default number of pre-filled rows is zero.</para>
     </sect3>
     <sect3 id="s3-densitypfr">
      <title>Density of Pre-filled Rows</title>
       <para>You can change the density of the blocks in the pre-filled rows at the start-up of each game. You can choose a density up to 10 blocks. You should first choose how many rows you want pre-filled under <guilabel>Number of Pre-filled Rows</guilabel>. The default density of blocks is three.</para>
     </sect3>
     <sect3 id="s3-startlevel">
      <title>Level to Start On</title>
       <para>You can adjust the level of difficulty you start on. The highest level you can start on is 10, which is the highest level you can play to. The default starting level is one.</para>

    <title>Customizing the Gameplay</title>
    <para>From <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, you can customize a variety of features related to the blocks: previewing the next block, block colors, and block rotation.</para>
      <sect3 id="s3-sound">
	<title>Enable sounds</title>
	<para>Turn the sound effects on and off using this option. If you are playing this game in any area which you share with other people, you should probably select off.</para>

     <sect3 id="s3-nextblock">
      <title>Preview Next Block</title>
        <para>Choose this option if you want to see the next block that is going to fall. This feature helps you plan the placement of your blocks.</para>

     <sect3 id="s3-blockcolors">
      <title>Use Random Block Colors</title>
       <para>Choose if you want the various block configurations to be color coded or randomly colored. If you use the colors to help you identify blocks, random colors will make the game more difficult.</para>
     </sect3>
     <sect3 id="s3-bastard-mode">
      <title>Bastard Mode</title>
       <para>Choose this option if you want to select mode that is designed specifically to annoy the player. With this feature enabled, you never get the piece you want, and very seldom complete a row. Next block preview doesn't correspond to actual piece you get next, but to the one you probably wish to get.</para>
     </sect3>
     <sect3 id="s3-block-rotation">
      <title>Rotate Blocks Counterclockwise</title>
       <para>Choose this option if you want the blocks to rotate counterclockwise or not.</para>
     </sect3>
     <sect3 id="s3-show-target">
      <title>Show where the block will land</title>
        <para>If this feature is used a grey image of the block will
  show you where the block will land. This feature is very useful for
  beginning players, but experienced players will find it a
  distraction.
